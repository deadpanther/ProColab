Fall 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Sociology. My interests are product management, data science, and software engineering. 

In 2017, I participated in the biggest tech/business competition at City College of New York (CCNY) where my team, PaxWalk, won the Standard Chartered Bank grand prize. PaxWalk is a safety app that helps college students find walking buddies. I was also selected to be part of Code/Interactive Tech Career Accelerator Program (TCAP), which is a 2-year mentorship and career development program for high potential students. 
 
During my senior year, I was the Social Media Coordinator in the Society of Women Engineers Club where I successfully raised awareness of SWE to improve support among women engineers at CCNY. I also taught an iOS CodePath course to CCNY students in order to build 7 mini-applications. 

In Summer 2019, I've joined QCC Techworks Coding Bootcamp to further my knowledge in SQL, MongoDB, Reactjs, and Javascript.

I first got into coding a few years back when I discovered the wonders of single board computers and I started building small gaming handhelds for simple pleasure. After getting comfortable with my ability to build these devices I realized that I only knew how to build the hardware but not the software. I was limited by my knowledge of coding. 
I started looking into coding and learning the basics and I fell in love. My hobby of making gameboys lead me to find my career path. I started researching on schools I could go to to learn to coding and eventually it lead me to lambda school and it was honestly the best decision of my life.

Science is one of the most beautiful and amazing things because of its ability to discover and create miracles, redefine and rewrite the history, and motivate the human beings to surpass the limits and keep us moving forward.
However, just like theory needs practical experiments, the base of science is Engineering, which sometimes appears to be more essential than science.
Science helps us to design and define our dream, meanwhile, Engineering helps build up them.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanjmendoza/,,"I'm a Software Developer at SAP Labs under their SAP Next Talent(SNT) Program, formally known as Silicon Valley Next Talent(SVNT) Program, and have been under contract for a year now. The SNT Program is an 18-month rotational program where I can work on different teams and technologies on each rotation. I'm a graduate from the University at Buffalo, School of Engineering and Applied Science with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am also a Bootcamp graduate from Fullstack Academy, based in New York City.

Currently, I am doing my second rotation on the Concur Data Plane - Business Intelligence team, where I recently had the opportunity to develop a Redshift Cluster Toggle to facilitate Redshift clusters' scheduling. The business justification for the toggle is to lower the team's incurring charges for on-demand resources by automating the pausing and resuming of clusters.

I worked on the SAP Conversational AI - Connect team in my first rotation, where I implemented many front-end and back-end features for the Slack, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft Teams, and LINE channels. One of the projects I had a significant impact was the migration from the Attachments API to the Block Kit API for our Slack channel. I delivered the Proof of Concept for the project, which helped the team measure the feasibility of the task.

During my time at the University at Buffalo, I participated at my University's Nano-Satellite Laboratory, a group of students that work on satellite contracts obtained from the Air Force Research Lab, NASA, and Moog. While at the laboratory, I had the opportunity to work on the GLADOS satellite, where I improved the magnetometer and worked on improving the gyroscope. 

I attended and completed Full Stack Academy while finishing my Bachelor's degree and have gone back to mentor recent Bootcamp graduates by providing mock technical interviews via white-boarding, pair programming, and code reviews. I've also offered 1:1 check-ins to set mentee goals, weekly job search schedules and discuss blockers via follow-up calls or texts.",Software Engineer at Square,"Brooklyn, New York, United States",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQG9wBzeIB1klg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1628732261294?e=1655942400&v=beta&t=FN8RFoWkGQbQHkYV5uFe628xiRJurLtR93GAt4FAQqM,Juan,Mendoza,Juan Mendoza,631,2nd,ACoAACVhKT8BZbJgdiv7wVxxIHDriLYgUlMpLkM,627124543,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAACVhKT8BZbJgdiv7wVxxIHDriLYgUlMpLkM,name",635,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACVhKT8BZbJgdiv7wVxxIHDriLYgUlMpLkM%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACVhKT8BZbJgdiv7wVxxIHDriLYgUlMpLkM%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,2 mutual connections: Yash Shirodkar and Tim Ruscica,Square,https://www.linkedin.com/company/675562/,Software Engineer,Mar 2022 - Present · 2 mos,SAP,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1115/,Software Developer,,Jan 2021 - Mar 2022 · 1 yr 3 mos,University at Buffalo,https://www.linkedin.com/company/6502/,"Bachelor of Science, Computer Science",2017 - 2020,Fullstack Academy,https://www.linkedin.com/company/15098574/,Full Stack Software Engineering,2020 - 2020,"Java, JavaScript, Python (Programming Language), Agile Methodologies, Programming, Web Development, Software Development, Analytical Skills, Troubleshooting, Debugging, Algorithms, Computer Science, Data Structures, HTML5, Python, C++, HTML, Eclipse, Github, Git, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Clion, Xcode, Bootstrap, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Unix, MongoDB, Node.js, React.js, Redux.js, Customer Service, Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Teamwork, Time Management, Self Learning, Active Learning, Programming Languages, Express.js, Full-Stack Development, Automated Software Testing, Back-End Web Development",Java,5,JavaScript,7,Python (Programming Language),4,Agile Methodologies,1,Programming,3,Web Development,5,https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanjmendoza?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACVhKT8BZbJgdiv7wVxxIHDriLYgUlMpLkM,juanjmendoza,2022-04-17T02:33:09.906Z,"San Francisco, California, United States",,,"• Built a Redshift Cluster Toggle App to toggle clusters between pause/resume states using Python3, Boto3, AWS Redshift, AWS Simple Notification Service, and Concurflow, saving the team $12,000/month.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-hennigar-644035b9/,,"Hey there! My name is Colin and I am a software engineer that solves problems with Django and Python. I was a labor organizer for 10 years with AFSCME, UFCW, and RWDSU but once the Covid-19 Pandemic hit in early 2020, I took the time off to pursue my lifelong passion with technology and took the leap to learn computer programming. 

I instantly fell in love with Python and studied day and night to keep sane during the quarantine. I have a dual focus, one being data extraction and mining which I use Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Pyspider, Openpyxl, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Regex mainly; And Web Development which I use Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, Heroku (or Docker if not hosted with Heroku), and CSS, HTML, and vanilla JavaScript for front end. I’m also learning React (slowly) but plan to spend more time on it once I get some free time from my current projects.

Currently I am doing some freelance work, took a temporary data pre-processing job for the holidays, and have some stealth projects that fall under SaaS and/or DaaS. 

I would love to work on a team and be a Junior Developer.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbeynon/,,"I’m a full stack Ruby on Rails engineer with a background in math, physics, and K-8 technology education. I’m a big proponent of test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration, and I believe that clear, well written code with solid test coverage is the key to high quality maintainable code that I—and my colleagues—won’t regret six months, or six years, from now.

As a student of physics, one of our most important problem-solving techniques was learning how to take difficult, complicated problems, break them into simple, easily solved subcomponents, rigorously solve each piece, and then compose them back together to form more powerful, general purpose solutions. So long as you don’t assume all cows are perfectly spherically symmetric, that is. I find this approach equally valid in software.

I’ve been programming in one way or another for over twenty years, from writing MS-DOS startup scripts (to optimize memory for Wing Commander, X-Wing, and other games, naturally), learning HTML in 1995, or writing programs in Fortran and MatLab during my physics curriculum. 2001 was my Year-of-the-Linux-Desktop (I’m a Gentoo guy), but I’ve always believed in the right tool for the right job and

https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmiller92/,,"Hello, Welcome to my Profile!

I have been working in the service industry for the past 7 years. Over that last couple of years I have developed a passion for developing Frontend and Backend applications. I am now planning to make a transition into tech, where I can combine my Technical skills with my service background. The part of my service industry background that I enjoyed the most was working and communicating with others. I excel in communication and teamwork allowing me to build relationships and a shared sense of purpose with my coworkers.

I've always had a passion for computers ever since I brought my first gaming PC in 2006. I eventually started building my own computers and seeing the inner hardware and connecting the components really inspired me to get a deeper understanding of the software and hardware inside. I graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program in December 2020.

I'm am currently seeking entry level roles as a Frontend or Full Stack Web Developer. Fell free to contact me on LinkedIn or by email at justin.alx.miller@gmail.com.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-batsoula-3983a218a/,,"While studying Psychology in college, I had a low-end laptop that seemed to fail me each time an important assignment was due. Chronic frustration grew to curiosity, and I found myself glued to the computer researching to build my own PC. This introduced me to the world of tech, and before I knew it, I was learning HTML while working as a Kitchen Assistant. Five years in the unpredictable and fast-paced catering business helped me easily develop trust with teammates, leading to effective and efficient collaboration that always results in events that clients love.

Since I have transitioned to a Web Developer, my priority is still building products that create experiences that users love. I have developed three apps (check them out below!), and I am currently working on a web app to help users document their gardens. Here are my favorites: 

WavesOn - Marine weather tracking app with a journalling feature, this was a real passion project for me because it enabled me to finally build out a way to check marine weather before going to the beach! I have this hosted on heroku, linked below under Featured, and Projects tabs! Check it out and please message me for any feedback!

_explore_ - A call to explore our solar system using NASA’s photo of the day, and Le Systeme Solaire API for pulling data on our neighboring celestial objects. This is a work in progress, but I have my Github repo link below!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-sinha-240208146/,,"I am an industrious and goal-oriented individual possessing the ability and motivation to tackle complex challenges head on. I acquired excellent organisational and execution skills by coordinating as well as organising several events in college fest and making those events successful by having an eye for small things. I am a quick learner who can imbibe new ideas and implement them those ideas in the project which exemplified by several multidisciplinary projects that I've undertaken. I displayed remarkable scholastic skill by obtaining good grades in academics. Lastly, I am a team player and have been a part of teams working on multidisciplinary projects, acknowledging team goals and team spirit above everything else.
Focused on Machine Learning, my primary area of research interest includes Deep Learning with Neuroscience, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I love learning new things and working on real world problems where I can put together my knowledge. I worked projects where I have collected huge amount of data-sets using physiological sensors and, web scrapped and analysed them, this project helped me in strengthening my data handling and data mining skills. As a part of my research internship at IIT Patna, I worked on development of a machine learning model which measures the accuracy of different human activities performed on daily basis which is to be used in development of biomedical sensors, working on this project I developed excellent understanding of complex Machine Learning algorithms and application of analytical tools for analysis of data. I authored a research paper that was published in the IEEE Indicon, 2018 and participated in several student paper & poster contests that braced my effective communication and presentation skills.
Skills 
Matlab, Python, Java, Latex, LT Spice, PS-CAD, Maxwell, Core Composer.

Trying to soak in the cutting edge technologies, working out science fictions on a regular basis while pursuing a degree in Robotics, is nothing but exhilerating. For the past two years, my motivation has driven me to learn from and work on the latest innovations in the fields of Robotic controls, Machine learning architectures and Computer vision algorithms.

Starting from participating in small scale Robowars and Hackathons, my career interests have grown to lie at the nexus of a variety of next-gen riddles. Solving these riddles like be it Robotic localization and mapping, or be it developing neural nets, or applying algorithms to estimate environments in Computer vision, all of them ends up bringing those minor 'Eureka!' moments for me. Moreover, I consider myself really fortunate that I got some relevant opportunities to work both at USA and India. My journey in the field of these algorithms has helped me track the task depths and then apply my ideas through Gazebo, Tensorflow, OpenCV and many such tools most essential for the jobs to be done. Logical Reasoning has always been my strength thus programming, my passion.
