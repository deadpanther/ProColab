## Project Description
A collaboration platform for students of various universities to work on projects together. The platform will leverage their skills and abilities to help them find suitable partners to help them on their projects.

## Problem Motivation
As we know this era is all about building online connections with everyone through social media platforms like, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. People are getting used to it now and they will use it in a better way for building pure connections that canâ€™t even help those people but also to the community. There are so many websites on which people are nowadays posting for job openings, their achievements, new roles and on top of everything companies are now hiring from these platforms. These platforms provide recommendations based on workplaces and universities. However, to collaborate on a project we need recommendations based on the skill set and project experiences. Our platform would solve this problem by providing profile based (i.e. resume) recommendations to students from different universities.
